Hi I am Alex and I am a Senior Data and Research Scientist at hema.to where I focus on applications of machine learning for leukemia diagnosis.  

I try to update this page frequently and add new research results, update my resume and publications list and blog posts. I write blog posts about various different topics, which are mainly related to applications of machine learning, trustworthy AI and sometimes computational neuroscience.
