Hi, Iâ€™m Alex, a Senior Data and Research Scientist at hema.to. I like Data Science and Data Engineering especially for Healthtech use cases.  

I frequently update this page with my latest resume, publications, and blog posts. My blog covers a variety of topics, primarily focused on data science and machine learning.
